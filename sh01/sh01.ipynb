How many exactly can be seen with the following sequence: 15, 8, 4, 2, 1. Explanation of this sequence is that the middle platform where we have to perform the experiment is determined by the formula: `(total platforms left + 1) // 2`. And the total platforms left in the next step is always the number of the middle platform from the previous step. So in total there will be 5 steps and each time a glass will break. \n",

    "   1. Test first glass in the highest platform in the lower third, i.e. the 11th platform. If it breaks then we must test the other glass in the remaining 10 platforms in the lower third linearly until it breaks the first time: 10 + 1 = **11** tries at worst.\n",
    "   2. if the first glass doesn't break, then we try the lowest platform in the upper third, i.e. the 21st platform with this glass. If the glass breaks here, then we search the middle third, i.e. we test the platforms 12..20 with the other glass linearly, until it breaks. This totals to 1 + 1 + 9 = **11** tries in worst case.\n",
    "   3. If first glass doesn't break in the 21st platform, then we continue to search the upper third platform with it, namely the platforms 22...30, linearly until the glass breaks or we reach the end. This totals to 1 + 1 + 9 = **11** tries in worst case.    "
