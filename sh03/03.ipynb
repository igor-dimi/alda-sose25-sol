    "The comment before a while or a for loop is specifically labeled as 'invariant' and is the invariant statement that stays true after the \n",

    "# Q\n",
    "```\n",

    "   then `i <= N` will hold after the incrementation, by simple arithmetic rules, which proves the invariant. \n",

    "\n",
    "1) **IB**: before the loop executes we have; `q == 0 and 0 <= x == r` therefore `x == r + q * y and r >= 0` holds trivially.\n",
    "2) **IS**: assume the invariant holds before some arbitrary execution of the loop. Assume that `r >= y` additionally holds, so we are\n",
    "   in the body of the loop. Now since the invariant holds we have\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   x == r + q * y and r >= 0 and r >= y\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   we can manipulate `r + q * y` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   r + q * y == (r - y) + (q + 1) * y\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   So after executing the body of the loop the `r` holds what previously was `r - y` and `q` holds what previously was `q + 1`. \n",
    "   But as shown above this leaves the value of expression unchanged, therefore after updating the variables `r` and `q` in the body\n",
    "   of the loop the equality `x == r + q * y` still holds. \n",
    "\n",
    "   Now we turn our attention to the second conjunct of the invariant: `r >= 0`. Since `r >= y` holds in the body of the loop, `r >= 0` still holds after the update to r - `r -= y`. \n",

    "   These two observations conclude our proof\n",
